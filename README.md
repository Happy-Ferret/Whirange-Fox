I did some testing on arch and windows and on both you need overall skin with white top element.

    Arch: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/deepin-gtk-theme/

    Windows 7: http://blademight.deviantart.com/art/Exon-by-BladeMight-648544389

Also on firefox you need to do some work, remove things you don't need with firefox customization option.
