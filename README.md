# What's new
Firefox 57+ (WebExtensions) can't edit browser appearance and only way is to edit files yourself,
so in this new way you don't need stylish just theme file more about it in Usage part.

# Whirange-Fox
Very basic, clean, white skin with orange accent color for Firefox/Waterfox.

#Usage

    1. get userChrome.css: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mindii/Whirange-Fox/master/userChrome.css
    
    2. Insert file to profile directory:
    Linux: ~/.waterfox/ PROFILID /chrome/userChrome.css
    Windows: C:\Users\ USERNAME \AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Waterfox\Profiles\ PROFILEID \chrome\userChrome.css
	
    Note: Userid is random id and there is usually only one, also chrome folder dosen't exist yet so create it.

#Usage (Pre Firefox 57)

    1. Download stylish from here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/

    2. Install from url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mindii/Whirange-Fox/master/firefox.css

I did some testing on arch and windows and on both you need overall skin with white top element.

    Arch: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/deepin-gtk-theme/

    Windows 7: http://blademight.deviantart.com/art/Exon-by-BladeMight-648544389

Also on firefox you need to do some work, remove things you don't need with firefox customization option.
